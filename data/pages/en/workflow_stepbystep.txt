====== Workflow step by step explanation ======

The Workflow module provides a number of options to trigger actions based on events in the application or time based events.

To configure a workflow for a module enter the application as an admin user, go to the //Settings// page and click on the //Workflows// link (this can be found under the //Other Settings// block)

This will bring up the list of all defined workflows (by default all workflows are listed). 

You can see all the available workflow for any particular module using the //Select Module// dropdown on the page.

The Workflow extension provides options to

  *create a new workflow 
  *edit an existing workflow 
  *delete an existing workflow

===== Create tasks  =====

Click on the //New Task// button to add a new task. You will get a popup to select the type of task you can create. There are multiple types of tasks, among which you may find:

  *//Send Email// task which can be used to send emails
  *//Invoke custom function// task which will call certain specific methods on the entity objects.
  *//Create Todo// task which will create a todo when the workflow condition is met. 
  *//Create Event// task, which will create an event.

Select a task type from the dropdown and click on the create button to create the task.

===== Configuring tasks =====

==== Common Fields  ====

The following fields are common for all workflow tasks 

  *//Task Title// - This is the title of the task used in the task list to identify the task. 
  *//Status// - This is a selection box which should be set to active if the task is to be executed when the workflow executes. 
  *//Execute the task after some delay// - If this is checked you will be provided with additional fields to specify a time delay for when the task will be executed. You can specify when the task is executed relative to the time in a date field on the record.

==== Invoke custom function  ====

This option provides a way for developers to [[en:invokecustomfunction_workflows| add module specific actions to workflows]]. To define a task, you need to define a method to be called. This method should be defined as a function in it's own file.

<code PHP>
<?php
function demo($entity){
    $entity->focus->called = true;
}
?>
</code>

The method then needs to be registered, for example if the method was defined in the file modules/demo/Demo.inc for the Contacts module and given the name method.

<code PHP>require_once 'include/utils/utils.php';
require 'modules/com_vtiger_workflow/VTEntityMethodManager.inc';
$emm = new VTEntityMethodManager($adb);
$emm->addEntityMethod("PurchaseOrder", "method", "modules/Workflow/Demo.inc", "demo");
</code>

The method will appear in the list of methods available for the Contacts module.

==== Todo Task  ====

Using this option, you can setup a workflow to create a new calendar Todo when a condition is matched. The following fields are provided in the create view of this option

  *Todo - The title of the todo. 
  *Description - Of the todo. 
  *Status - The status of the todo, can be selected from the dropdown 
  *Priority - The priority of the todo, can be selected from the dropdown. 
  *Time - The start time of the todo, in 24 hours time. 
  *Due Date - The due date for the todo, the start date is also set using this. 
  *Send Notification - Set the send notification flag.

If the module which triggers the workflow is Contacts then the //Contact Name// field will be bound to the contact. If the module is one of the acceptable modules for the Related To field then the module //Related To// field will be bound to the module.

==== Event Task  ====

This is same as Todo task other than that it creates an event instead of a task.
