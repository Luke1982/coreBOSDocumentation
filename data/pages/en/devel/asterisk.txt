??? Since the extension is polling, is there a way to reduce the number of events detected.

!!! Configure your asterisk server with the next settings to filter events by putting them in manager.conf (in freepbx it would be manager_custom.conf) (asterisk >= 1.8):
<code>
read = all
write = all
writetimeout = 2000
eventfilter=!Event: DMTF
eventfilter=!Event: RTCPSent
eventfilter=!Event: RTCPReceived
eventfilter=!Event: VarSet
eventfilter=!Event: Cdr
eventfilter=!Event: ExtensionStatus
eventfilter=!Event: ChannelUpdate
eventfilter=!Event: PeerStatus
eventfilter=!Event: Registry
</code>

Since we applied this change the asteriskclient is much more stable.
